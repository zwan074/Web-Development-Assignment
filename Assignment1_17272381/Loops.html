        <h2>Javascript Loops</h2>
        <p>
            Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.<br /><br />


            JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:<br /><br />
            <ul>
                <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
                <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
                <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
                <li>
                    do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>The For Loop.</h3>

        <p>The for loop has the following syntax:</p>

        <div class=" code_box">
            for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
            code block to be executed
            }

        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.</li>
            <li>Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.</li>
            <li>
                Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
            </li>

        </ul>





        <div class=" code_box">
            for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {<br/>
            text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";<br/>
            }<br/>
        </div>

        <p>
            From the example above, you can read:<br /><br />

            Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (var i = 0).<br /><br />

            Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).<br /><br />

            Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <h3>The For/In Loop</h3>
        <p>The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object:</p>

        <div class=" code_box">
            var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};<br/><br/>

            var text = "";<br/>
            var x;<br/>
            for (x in person) {<br/>
            text += person[x];<br/>
            }
        </div>




        <h3>The While Loop</h3>
        <p>
            The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
        </p>

        <div class=" code_box">
            Syntax<br/>
            while (condition) {<br/>
            code block to be executed<br/>
            }<br/>

        </div>
        <p>
            Example<br /><br />

            In the following example, the code in the loop will run,
            over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 10:<br /><br />

        </p>




        <div class=" code_box">

            while (i < 10) {
            text += "The number is " + i;
            i++;
            }

        </div>


        <h3>The Do/While Loop</h3>

        <p>
            The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once,
            before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.<br/><br/>

            Syntax
        </p>
        <div class=" code_box">
            do {<br/>
            code block to be executed<br/>
            }<br/>
            while (condition);<br/><br/>


        </div>
            
        <p>
            Example<br/><br/>

            The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once,<br/>
            even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:<br/>


        </p>


        <div class=" code_box">

            do {<br/>
            text += "The number is " + i;<br/>
            i++;<br/>
            }<br/>
            while (i < 10);<br/>

        </div>

        <p>

            Do not forget to increase the variable used in the condition, otherwise the loop will never end!<br/><br/>

            Comparing For and While<br/><br/>

            If you have read the previous chapter, about the for loop, 
            you will discover that a while loop is much the same as a for loop, 
            with statement 1 and statement 3 omitted.<br/><br/>

            The loop in this example uses a for loop to collect the car names from the cars array:<br/>

        </p>

        <div class=" code_box">
            var cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];<br/>
            var i = 0;<br/><br/><br/>
            var text = "";<br/><br/>

            for (;cars[i];) {<br/>
            text += cars[i] + "<br>";<br/>
            i++;<br/>
            }<br/>

        </div>

        <p>

            The loop in this example uses a while loop to collect the car names from the cars array:

        </p>

        <div class=" code_box">
            var cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];<br/>
            var i = 0;<br/>
            var text = "";<br/>

            while (cars[i]) {<br/>
            text += cars[i] + "<br>";<br/>
            i++;<br/>
            }<br/>



        </div>
